BUILD GUIDE FOR ADDTWO PACKAGE
==============================

This guide outlines the steps to build and publish the 'AddTwo' Python package to PyPI.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
Ensure you have the 'build' and 'twine' tools installed:
    pip install --upgrade build twine

STEP 0: UPDATE VERSION
----------------------
Before building a new release, you must increment the version number.

1. Open 'pyproject.toml'.
2. Find the line starting with 'version ='.
3. Increment the version (e.g., from "0.1.3" to "0.1.4").
4. Save the file.


STEP 1: CLEAN PREVIOUS BUILDS
-----------------------------
Remove any existing 'dist/' directory to ensure a clean build:
    # On Windows (PowerShell)
    if (Test-Path dist) { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist }
    
    # On Unix/macOS
    # rm -rf dist/

STEP 2: BUILD THE PACKAGE
-------------------------
Run the build command from the root directory of the project (where pyproject.toml is located):
    python -m build

This will generate distribution files (typically a .tar.gz source archive and a .whl wheel file) in the 'dist/' directory.

STEP 3: CHECK THE PACKAGE
-------------------------
Verify that the package description and metadata will render correctly on PyPI:
    twine check dist/*

STEP 4: UPLOAD TO TESTPYPI (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------------------
TestPyPI is a separate instance of PyPI for testing.
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

To install from TestPyPI to verify:
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps addtwo-Monu

STEP 5: UPLOAD TO PYPI
----------------------
Once you are confident, upload the package to the real Python Package Index:
    twine upload dist/*

You will need your PyPI username and password (or an API token).

DONE
----
Your package should now be live on PyPI and installable via 'pip install addtwo-Monu'.

QUICK REFERENCE COMMANDS
------------------------
# 1. Update version manually in pyproject.toml first!

# 2. Clean
if (Test-Path dist) { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist }

# 3. Build
python -m build

# 4. Check
twine check dist/*

# 5. Upload to TestPyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# 6. Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*
